This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our AAAI-2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446), in which we propose DiffSinger (for Singing-Voice-Synthesis) and DiffSpeech (for Text-to-Speech).

## Audio Demos
Old audio samples can be found in our [demo page](https://diffsinger.github.io/). Audio samples generated by this repository are listed here:

### TTS audio samples
Speech samples (test set of LJSpeech) can be found in [resources/demos_1213](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/blob/master/resources/demos_1213). 

### SVS audio samples
Singing samples (test set of PopCS) can be found in [resources/demos_0112](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger/blob/master/resources/demos_0112).
